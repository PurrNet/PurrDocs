### Adding it to your project

You can add PurrNet to your project in 3 ways:

**Git (Package Manager):** Through the package manager you can add a package using a git URL. Just add the following URL, and whenever you need PurrNet updated, you can update it directly from the package manager:

```
https://github.com/PurrNet/PurrNet.git?path=/Assets/PurrNet#release
```

**Unity Asset store:** It's as easy as going to the asset store using this link, and adding it like a normal package: [https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/297320](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/297320)

**GitHub (Package Import):** You can download the latest release from [this page](https://github.com/BlenMiner/PurrNet/releases) and simply double click it to import it into your project

You can now continue on to the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page
