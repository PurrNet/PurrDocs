# Network Reflection (Auto Sync)

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/MV2oIx77K6o" %}

The Network Reflection component will take another component as input, and will expose any values within, in order for you to toggle which should be automatically synchronized across the network. This makes it super easy for you to convert your scripts from single player to multiplayer. This can be done with any component, even Unity default ones.

It also holds the "Owner Auth" setting, in order to change who is responsible for this synchronizing, whether that'd be the owner or server.
